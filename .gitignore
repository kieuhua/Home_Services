# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
home_service/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
home_service/db/*.sqlite3
home_service/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
home_service/log/*
home_service/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

home_service/.byebug_history
